# EDA Telco Customer Churn
The Telco customer churn data contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.

In this project, dataset used is about customers cancel their subscription and stop using their services. A particular telecommunication company requires help in coming up with a business solution in order to solve their issue with customers churning. Apart from that, the company would also like to know if a customer is worth retaining.

Objective Statement :
- Predict behavior to retain customers
- Focused customer retention programs

Business Benefit :
Acquiring a new customer is always more expensive than retaining an existing one. Hence, not letting them churn is the key to a sustained revenue stream

The process to do with this project are :
1. Import libraries and load the data
2. Data cleansing (missing value and duplicate rows handling), Exploratory data analysis (EDA) which consists of preliminary look at the data, and data deep-dive understanding (statistical summary, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis)
3. Expected Outcome (conclusions and recommendations)

Dataset Informations :
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Conclusions :
- All features in the dataset are used to analysing
- A lot of monthly subscribers chose to continue using the company's service, also, a lot of them were not satisfied, they churned
- Customers who did yearly (one year and two year) subscription were satisfied with the company's service

Recommendation :
Giving discounts to customers who subscribe to monthly allows the reduction for customers to leave and the churned to be lower. Upgrading customers' subscriptions would mean more income for the company.
